"""
    This file runs and executes a PCEC model, calculating the faradaic efficiency and ohmic resistance as a function of the electrolyte thickness. 

    The code structure at this level is meant to be very simple, and delegates most functions to lower-level modules, which can be updated with new capabilties, over time.  The code:

        1 - Initializes the model by calling pcec_params.py
            a - pcec_params.py reads in the user inputs from pemfc_inputs.py, 
            b - pcec_params.py then creates an initial solution vector 'SV_0'
            c - pcec_params.py returns SV_0 and a class 'pars' holding all simulation parameters.
        
        2 - Calls the residual function and integrates over the user-defined    
            time span. (will change this to only looks at steady state in the future)

        3 - The simulation then returns the solution vector at the end of the 
            integration, which can be processed as needed to plot or analyze any quantities of interest.
